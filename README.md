## About
Thanks for checkout out weLunch&Learn. This is my first capstone project as a programmer and it was built during my time at Launch Academy, a Boston-area web development bootcamp focused on React and Ruby on Rails. I really enjoyed creating this application and tackling a common and persistant business problem. This development process has been an incredible learning experience and look forward to continuing my eduction in web programming through future releases. 

**Please note that weLunch&Learn is still very much a work in progress!** :wink:

## The Business Problem
A lunch-and-learn is an aptly-named catered event where a external or internal presenter shares his or her wisdom to a group of presentees. Despite sounding trivial, note the slew of important data needed for coordination prior to holding the event:
- Availability of Presenter
- Availability of Presentee Group
- Number of Attendees
- Food Preferences for Presentee Group
  - General Likes/Dislikes
  - Allergies
  - Target Cost Per Person
- Presentation Location & Access
  - Directions to Location
  - Parking Instructions
  - Building Access
- Miscellaneous Notes
  - ie: "Head of Marketing the will be in attendance."
